# Guess The Song
This Organization holds all source, documentation and everything else connected to [Guess The Song](https://gts.thaemisch.com)

## Selfhost
### Docker (WIP) (Recommended)
The Docker image is still a work in progress and does not work at the moment.
All information on how to host your own instance using Docker is in the repo [Guess-The-Song/docker](https://github.com/Guess-The-Song/docker)

### Build Manually
This is not recommended, but if you want to run the individual services on bare-metal, check out the READMEs in the [Client](https://github.com/Guess-The-Song/client) and [Server](https://github.com/Guess-The-Song/server) repos.

## Made by
[thaemisch](https://github.com/thaemisch) and [ob-julian](https://github.com/ob-julian), initially as a project for a university class.
