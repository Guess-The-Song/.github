# Guess The Song
This Organization holds all source, documentation and everything else connected to the [Guess The Song Website](https://gts.thaemisch.com).

## Selfhost
### Docker (WIP) (Recommended)
The Docker image is still a work in progress and does not work at the moment.

### Build Manually
This is not recommended, but if you want to run the individual services on bare-metal, check out the READMEs in the [Client](https://github.com/Guess-The-Song/client) and [Server](https://github.com/Guess-The-Song/server) repos.

## Made by
[thaemisch](https://github.com/thaemisch) and [ob-julian](https://github.com/ob-julian), initially as a project for a university class.
